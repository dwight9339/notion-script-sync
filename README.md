# Notion Script ↔ Storyboard Sync Utility

## Overview

This project streamlines the process of synchronizing a granular YouTube video script (written as a nested document) with a Notion storyboard database.  
It’s designed for creators who want creative freedom in drafting scripts—while maintaining precise, up-to-date alignment with their production visuals and assets.

- **Write your script as a structured, human-friendly outline.**
- **Use unique “beat IDs” to link each script line to its corresponding storyboard entry.**
- **Automatically propagate all script changes to the storyboard database—no manual cross-linking required.**

## Why This Structure?

**Traditional scripts** are written as linear documents, making it hard to manage updates, keep visuals aligned, or support iterative revisions.  
By using a **triple-nested format (Section.Paragraph.Beat)** for the script and referencing beats in the storyboard, this project gives you:

- Maximum writing fluency—script in outline form, not row-by-row
- Granular, robust mapping between every script “beat” and storyboard asset
- Easy updates, even as you rearrange or revise large sections
- Clear separation between scripting (“what’s said”) and storyboarding (“what’s shown”)
